# Frametrap 

> frametrap is *very* early in development. Definitely do not use it just yet. 

A cross platform screen capture library for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

Frametrap can:
  - Deliver live frame information from your screen.
  - Capture GIFs.
  - Export frames as PNGs.

## Why?

I wanted a screen capture app that lets me control the compression, quantization, dithering, etc.
Surprisingly, there's nothing that can do all that on all three major OSes (well, except for FFMPEG – but that's a command line tool).

Hopefully, once the library is mature is mature enough, I'll be able to use it to build such an app.
While I'm still figuring thngs out, you can try [LICECap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) — it's pretty solid!

## Goals

- Cross platform
  - **MacOS**: ScreenCaptureKit and CoreGraphics (AVFoundation at some point).
  - **Windows**: Win32 API.
  - **Linux**:  Figure something out with Wayland / dbus.
- Fast. Drop as few frames as possible.
- Control over parameters such as FPS, Quantization algorithm, dithering, etc.
